# Library App Documentation

This documentation provides an brief overview of the **Library App**, a project developed for the JavaScript course within The Odin Project curriculum. The Library App enables users to add, view, modify, and delete books in a digital library through an interactive interface. The focus of this project is to practice using JavaScript constructors, array manipulation, and DOM manipulation to build dynamic web applications.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the project is available at: [Library App Demo](https://rsvinicius.github.io/library/)

## Features

- **Library Management**: Users can add books with details such as title, author, page count, and read status, stored in an array for structured data handling.
- **Dynamic Display**: All books are dynamically displayed in a card layout that updates automatically upon changes in the library.
- **Add Book Form**: A "+" button brings up a form for adding new books, with validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Read Status Toggle**: Each book card includes a select to toggle the book status (not read, reading, read), giving users flexibility in tracking reading progress.
- **Delete Book Functionality**: Users can easily remove books from the library with a single click.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Follows the concept of separating data logic from display logic, enhancing code maintainability and scalability.

## Future Enhancements

- **Persistent Storage**: Add localStorage to save books between sessions.
- **Advanced Search**: Add a search or filter function to easily locate specific books.
- **Enhanced UI**: Additional styling or animations for a more interactive experience.
